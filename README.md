## `go-ead-to-solr`

### PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This package parses EAD 2002 files and generates XML documents that  
can be POSTed to a Solr instance configured with an appropriate  
[`schema.xml` file](https://github.com/NYULibraries/specialcollections/blob/master/solr/conf/schema.xml).
